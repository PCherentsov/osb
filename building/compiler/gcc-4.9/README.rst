Warning
=======
* GCC 4.9 is in the experimental phase of development, it seems to be very unstable.

* For 64-bit gcc, your host computer must have SSSE3 instruction set support.

* Due to PR57848 (http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57848), some gcc
  packages (\*_by48.7z) build with gcc 4.8 on x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.
